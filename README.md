# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo was created for the final course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course.
Here's what you'll find inside this repo:
* A CODEBOOK.md file that contains the study design and codebook.
* A run_analysis.R script that creates the tidy dataset from the raw dataset.
* The tidy dataset saved as tidy.csv, because .csv files look better than .txt files.
* All the raw data files in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.
I hope you like what you see.
