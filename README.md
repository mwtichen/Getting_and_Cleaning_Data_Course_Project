# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
This repo was created for the final course project
in the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course.
This repo contains:
1) Two text files from the smartphone dataset
	README.txt and features_info.txt
	where README.txt explains the experiment
	and features_info.txt explains the original
	variables in the dataset
2) An R script, run_analysis.R, that produces a
	tidy dataset
3) A codebook, that explicitly tells the steps used
	to produce the tidy dataset
